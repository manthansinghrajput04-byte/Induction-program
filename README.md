Day 1 (30 July 2025 – Electrical Engineering)

Finally, the day I had been waiting for arrived — my very first day at GNDEC. The morning began with a peaceful kirtan at the gurdwara around 8:30 AM, setting a calm and positive tone. After that, we were served some tea and snacks, which was a nice way to settle in before heading to the auditorium.

There, our Principal Sir welcomed us and shared some powerful thoughts about the role of discipline, enthusiasm, and dedication in our lives as future engineers. I was amazed to hear that GNDEC was founded back in 1956 and is now celebrating 70 years — it made me feel proud to be part of such a long-standing institution.

One of the speakers said something that really stayed with me — that engineering is not just about machines or software, but about solving actual problems in the real world using creativity and courage. Throughout the day, I got a chance to interact with some of my new batchmates, and surprisingly, I felt a connection with a few already.

Looking around, it was clear that the college is putting in serious effort to provide us with a great learning environment and supportive faculty. That makes me want to give my best too — not just in academics, but in becoming a responsible and capable individual.

Day 2 (01 August 2025)

Our second day kicked off with a very meaningful session on Universal Human Values (UHV) led by Dr. Priya Darshini Madam. She talked about living with purpose, understanding ourselves better, and building strong, respectful relationships with others.

After that, we had a fun and engaging session on personality development with Dr. Arvind Dhingra Sir. What made it special was how interactive it was — there were games, group activities, and discussions that helped us see the importance of communication, teamwork, and self-confidence.

Overall, the day felt light-hearted yet full of important lessons — a great combination of fun and learning.

Day 3 (03 August 2025)

Today was all about balancing personal growth and technical learning. We started off with another session on UHV, where we reflected more deeply on topics like goal clarity and inner harmony. Dr. Priya Darshini Madam reminded us how essential it is to be a good human first — that’s what makes a great engineer.

Later, we had our first C++ programming class, where we got introduced to input and output functions using cin and cout. We even wrote a small program to print our names. It was simple but exciting, and it got me curious about how programming works.

In the second half, we attended a Physics lecture where we covered basic topics like motion and measurement. The best part was how the teacher related everything to practical engineering applications, which made the theory much easier to understand.

Day 4 (04 August 2025)

The day started with yet another thought-provoking UHV session, again led by Dr. Priya Darshini Madam. This time, we went even deeper into how values shape our decisions, relationships, and academic journey. Her words made me reflect on how personal ethics and inner clarity can make a big difference in life.

Next, we returned to C++ programming, where we got more comfortable with writing code using basic input/output. It’s amazing how a few lines of code can perform meaningful tasks. I’m starting to enjoy the logic-building aspect of it.

After that, we had another Physics class, where we dug deeper into core concepts like physical quantities and how they’re measured. What stood out was how the teacher showed the real-world relevance of everything we studied. It made me realize that physics really is the backbone of all branches of engineering.

Day 5 (05 August 2025)

Today’s session was different but really interesting. It was about millets, which the speaker referred to as a “super food.” We learned how millets are packed with nutrients like fiber and iron and how they’re great for the environment because they need much less water compared to other crops.

The talk made me think about how traditional foods like millets can play a big role in both personal health and sustainable agriculture. It was a refreshing change from the usual technical sessions — informative in a totally different way.

Day 6 (06 August 2025)

We had three amazing sessions in the auditorium today. First, Dr. Parminder Singh, Dean of Student Welfare, welcomed us and talked about student life and support at GNDEC. Then, Mr. Manpreet Singh led a session titled “Fitness for Engineers”, where he stressed how important it is to take care of both our physical and mental health.

The highlight of the day was the talk by Brigadier P.S. Cheema Sir, who shared real-life leadership experiences and gave us a glimpse into how discipline, courage, and values shape strong individuals.

Later, we went back to our classes. In English, we practiced grammar and improved our communication skills with Prof. Nisha, followed by another solid Physics class with Prof. Amarjot Kaur, who made even the toughest concepts easier to grasp.

Day 7 (07 August 2025)

Today began with a Mathematics lecture by Prof. Sukhminder Singh, where we worked through some key problem-solving techniques. It was a good refresher and also gave insight into how math connects with real engineering problems.

Next, we had a Physics class with Prof. Jaspreet Singh, who introduced us to the topic of Electromagnetism. It was fascinating to learn how electric and magnetic fields interact — especially for us as Electrical Engineering students.

The day ended with two inspiring talks in the auditorium — one by Dr. Lakhvir Singh Khana (Incharge – CML) and the other by Dr. Jasvir Singh Grewal (Incharge – NSS). Both shared powerful thoughts on leadership, service, and how to grow as individuals beyond the classroom.

Conclusion

The induction program at GNDEC was a great way to begin my college journey. It gave us a clear picture of the college environment, the support available, and what is expected from us. I also got to meet amazing classmates and faculty, and I already feel a strong connection to this place.

With a mix of personality development sessions, technical classes, and real-life learning, this week helped me grow in more ways than one. I feel more motivated, confident, and ready to take on the challenges of engineering life ahead.
